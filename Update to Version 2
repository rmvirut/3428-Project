Created a fork of my university project to "make it better" now that I've gotten more experience. Making a few design changes to:
1. Make it mobile friendly by adding jQuerymobile
2. Less "time-based" and more "event-driven"
3. Proper handling of situations like no location and no wifi
4. Redesigning the GUI
5. Adding more options like location form and to-do list
